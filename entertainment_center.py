    """An elderly man reads the book \"The Princess Bride\" to his sick and
    thus currently bedridden adolescent grandson, the reading of the book
    which has been passed down within the family for generations. The
    grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core,
    he preferring something with lots of action and \"no kissing\". But the
    grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn't
    want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has
    been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian.
    Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one
    true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm,
    his stock answer of \"as you wish\" to any request she made of him which
    she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But
    Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts.
    On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage,
    Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his
    wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn,
    and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire
    life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread
    Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men
    led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent
    partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see
    other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of
    individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson
    will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he
    sees justice as high a priority as action.""",
