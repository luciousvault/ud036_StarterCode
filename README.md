# Movie Trailer Website Project
The movie trailer website project is a python based project used to demonstrate an understanding of how to use server side python to build HTML pages. The HTML page is intended to display a movie poster image and movie trailer when clicked. The movies are a few movies which I've deemed worthy to be listed.

# Quickstart
1. Install [Python 2.__latest__](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download source from this [repository](https://github.com/luciousvault/ud036_StarterCode)
3. Launch IDLE for python
4. Open entertainment_center.py
   - Example File Path: __C:\Users\ComputerName\directory dtructure\ud036_StarterCode\entertainment_center.py__
5. Select Run Module command from the Run menu dropdown
   - TLDR: press __f5__ after file opened.

# Citation/Explanation:
Movie storyline are mostly pulled from IMDB Plot page for the movie discribed. By searching the title of the movie on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com) and selecting the "Plot Summary" link you can find the plot page. Most of theplot descriptions are user written. I'm using the Summarys under the Educational portion of the Fair Use Act.
